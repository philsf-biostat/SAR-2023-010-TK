# Results

## Study population and follow up

In total, there were `r Nobs_final` participants included in the study, of which
`r inline_text(tab_desc, variable = gender, level = "Female")` were women (Table 1).
The average (SD) age of the study participant was
`r inline_text(tab_desc, variable = age)` years.

All baseline and end-of-study levels of the outcomes can be seen in Table 1.

```{r tab_desc}
tab_desc %>%
  as_kable(              # only for markdown
  # as_flex_table(       # only for DOCX
  # ) %>%
  # flextable::set_caption(
    caption = "**Table 1** Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of study participants."
  )
```

The distribution density of change in outcome levels can be seen in Figure 1.
The average change in CAL was slightly higher in the Gel 40 group when compared to Gen-Os group, but its distribution appears to be bi-modal.
This could be explained by the larger amount of participants in the lower range of REC change when compared to the Gen-Os group.

The PD change distribution appears slightly bi-modal in the Gel 40 group, and the average change was higher than the Gen-Os group.
The REC change appear to have similar averages in both groups, but as mentioned above the Gel 40 group has a heavier tail at the lower range of data.
The distributions of TP in both groups appear similar in center, width and shape.
